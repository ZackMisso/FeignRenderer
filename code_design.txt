Code style design etiquitte:

All method names and variables should follow: method_name()
All class and struct names use Pascal case:   ClassName
    if a number begins the next word, the following character is lower case.
    Example: Point3f
All macros should follow:                     MACRO_NAME

Numbers should not be used in method names unless denoting different
degrees of parameterization. Example: 
    Point3f is acceptable
    divide_by_2() -> should be avoided
    divide_by_two() -> preferred
Numbers can be used freely in variable names. Both of these are fine:
    int divided_by_2 = x / 2;
    int divided_by_two = x / 2;
