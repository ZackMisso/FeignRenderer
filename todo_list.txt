TODO notes:

create a way of telling feign to save the scene graph to a file
    after every render to quickly recreate renders after making changes.
need to add namespace parameters
need to write a blender scene file to feign scene file parser
really need to make that 3D editor
automatically create simple shaders if none are specified
create distant light sources
implement volumetric path tracer
get automated tests to work
change objects to take in param structs instead of each individual variable
create automated scene testing
implement operator accessors on all nodes to simplify text
currently one Mesh can only be used by one object at a time
move save location for renders to scene instead of integrators
implement cube map
implement sphere map
implement individual functions for each object type in the json parser for
    cleaner and clearer code
parallelize the parsing code
create my own memory allocator - ambitious
