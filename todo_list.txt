TODO notes:

remake shader system so that shaders are evaluated first instead of materials
create distant light sources
create directional light sources
implement path tracer
implement volumetric path tracer
get automated tests to work
change objects to take in param structs instead of each individual variable
rethink the current structure for evaluating bsdfs
create automated scene testing
implement operator accessors on all nodes to simplify text
currently one Mesh can only be used by one object at a time
move save location for renders to scene instead of integrators
implement cube map
implement sphere map
implement individual functions for each object type in the json parser for
    cleaner and clearer code
parallelize the parsing code
start planning shader frameworks
create my own memory allocator - ambitious
