Hello thanks for reading this. The Feign rendering engine is one of my hobby projects and as such should be expected to be in a volatile state as I only work on this project when I have free time.

I will eventually fully document the features of the engine, but for now please feel free to look at the example unit test scenes in scenes/unit_tests/scenes/. Any of them should be able to be ran by,

mkdir build && cd build cmake .. && ./feign -uri "test_index"

Here are some interesting example images / projects I have created using my rendering engine.
