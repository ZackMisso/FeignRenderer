Until the proper infrastructure is implemented, this document will
serve as the summary of what features each unit test is supposed to
cover

For reference below is a list of sphere tracing related tests

List and summary of tests:

test_000

tests the normal integrator, and loading of triangle meshes

test_001

tests the whitted integrator on a scene of only diffuse objects

test_002

tests the unidirectional path tracing integrator when the max number
of bounces has been set to 1. This should give similar results to
test_001, except there may be added noise.

test_003

This tests the full unidirectional path tracing integrator on a scene
with only diffuse objects

test_004

This tests the ambient occlusion integrator on a simple scene

test_005

This tests the mirror bsdf when using the whitted integrator.

test_006

This tests the mirror bsdf when using the unidirectional path tracing
integrator

test_007

This tests the phong bsdf when using the unidirectional path tracing
integrator

test_008

This tests the phong bsdf when using the whitted integrator

test_009

This scene tests the dielectric bsdf when using the unidirectional path tracing
integrator

test_010

This scene tests the dielectric bsdf when using the whitted integrator

test_011

This scene tests the unidirectional path tracing integrator when using area
light sources and only terminating after one bounce.

test_012

This scene tests the whitted integrator when using are light sources

test_013

This scene tests the unidirectional path tracing integrator when using area
light sources and evaluating up to at most 10 bounces

test_014

This scene tests the unidirectional path tracing integrator when using area
light sources and the phong bsdf

test_026

This scene tests the cylinder sdf by rendering surface normals with a plane and
cylinder object

test_027

This scene tests the cone sdf by rendering surface normals with a plane and
cone object

test_028
