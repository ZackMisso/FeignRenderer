Until the proper infrastructure is implemented, this document will
serve as the summary of what features each unit test is supposed to
cover

test_000

tests the normal integrator, and loading of triangle meshes

test_001

tests the whitted integrator on a scene of only diffuse objects

test_002

tests the unidirectional path tracing integrator when the max number
of bounces has been set to 1. This should give similar results to
test_001, except there may be added noise.

test_003

This tests the full unidirectional path tracing integrator on a scene
with only diffuse objects

test_004

This tests the ambient occlusion integrator on a simple scene

test_005

This tests the mirror bsdf when using the whitted integrator.

test_006

This tests the mirror bsdf when using the unidirectional path tracing
integrator

test_007

This tests the phong bsdf when using the unidirectional path tracing
integrator

test_008

This tests the phong bsdf when using the whitted integrator

test_009

This scene tests the dielectric bsdf when using the unidirectional path tracing
integrator
