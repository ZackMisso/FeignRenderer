Scenes files are broken down into descriptions of major scene nodes
where the beginning and end of every major node is specified, and the
properties of every node are defined in the middle. It is very similar
to xml except with specific rules and the lack of '<' or '>' characters.

Nodes which require all of their attributes to be specified do not need
to have an end token. Where as nodes which have a dynamic set of
attributes must always have an end token. End tokens are specified by
a '/' character followed by the name of the node.

camera ... /camera

Indentations, spaces, and new lines have no effect on the file format
and can be set to the users discretion.

Comments are specified by the use of the '<' and '>' characters.
