Scene files are broken down into descriptions of individual scene nodes comprising
of individual pieces of the scene. Any interrelations between scene nodes are
referenced by name instead of being defined recursively. For example:

{
    "light": {
        "name": "light_01"
        "shape": "shape_01"
    }

    "shape": {
        "name": "shape_01"
        "type": "triangle_mesh"
        "file": "triangle_mesh.obj"
    }
}

As can be seen above, the scene files are written and read from json files. This
project utilizes rapidjson for handling all io.
