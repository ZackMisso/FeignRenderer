List of features to add to the renderer

( zack's notes )
    "+" means that this is currently being worked on

+ Environment Maps (why did I never have support for this?)
+ Full Basic SDF support - master branch
Interpolation scheme support for scene variables
Path Tracing with (full) MIS
Spectral Rendering
NVIDIA Ray-Marching
Bidirectional Path Tracing
Integrate performance analysis everywhere
BSSRDFs
Dipole method
Directional Dipole method
Disney BSDF
SDF refractions
IES support
Easy to integrate Macros (dear zack from the past - what did this mean?)
Instanced Geometry - Need to look into embrees features
Subdivision Embree support
Import scenes from obj files (Maya + Blender)
UI for creating/editing scenes + scenegraphs
Fur rendering

Refactors:
    remove the media abstraction and just keep standard medium
    remove the material abstraction and just represent everything as shaders
    add a check to keep material shaders from being used as geometry shaders
    what the heck is a functor, and why did i make it
    create basic documentation

unit tests to create:
    Homogeneous medium
    Heterogeneous medium
    unit tests for all sdf intersection types
    unit tests for all sdf basic operations
    unit tests for sdf material interpolation
