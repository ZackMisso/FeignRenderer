Refactors:
    remove the media abstraction and just keep standard medium
    remove the material abstraction and just represent everything as shaders
    add a check to keep material shaders from being used as geometry shaders
    create a separate projects repository and keep it separate from the renderer
        to allow for small edits and other things while not stopping development
    redo the unit tests library, and keep the unit tests as part of this project
    fix the cmakelists file to not have to keep track of every file
