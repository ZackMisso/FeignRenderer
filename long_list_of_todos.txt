This is just a collection of minor todos to make sure I get to them
eventually.

Todo:

Need to make tests for spotlight to make sure it is works correctly
Need to remove the material abstraction as it is basically the same as
a shader within the concept of this renderer.
The unit tests are currently segfaulting, need to figure out why
    - I think I broke the sdfs last time I worked on the renderer
Rename fr_mesh to fr_shape in api.h
Add "override" to all implementations of abstractions for a small
    performance boost.
Need to figure out a nicer way of programmatically automating params.
    params should be passed in as parameters instead of setting all the
    values outside of the actual implementations.
Maybe change the names of BSDFs in the future once Microfacet distributions
    are working.
