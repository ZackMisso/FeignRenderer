This is just a collection of minor todos to make sure I get to them
eventually.

Todo:

Need to make tests for spotlight to make sure it is works correctly
Need to remove the material abstraction as it is basically the same as
a shader within the concept of this renderer.
The unit tests are currently segfaulting, need to figure out why
    - I think I broke the sdfs last time I worked on the renderer
