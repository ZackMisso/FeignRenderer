**Feign Renderer Documentation**

Author: Zack Misso

Current version: v.0.1.1

BEFORE YOU CONTINUE READING, THIS IS NOT UP TO DATE YET AS THE CODE BASE IS
EXTREMELY VOLATILE.

This interactive document provides the full writeup and documentation for the
Feign Renderer as well as its API and how to integrate it into other programs
or pipelines. It is my goal to eventually work in animation so I have attempted
to implement and design this hobby renderer in such a way to support integration
into my own animation editor. I also hope to eventually get this renderer into a
state where myself or others can utilize it for research purposes.

This living document is structured into a few separate pages which explain the
supported objects and features in this renderer as well as an overall summary of
the api. I am also including a page describing planned features for the renderer
and projections for when they will be completed.
