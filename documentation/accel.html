Ray Intersection Acceleration Structures
========================================

The feign renderer is designed to support two different compositions of scenes.
Scenes which comprise only of triangle meshes, and scenes which contain only
signed distance fields.

Aesthetically, I really like some of the art that has been generated by the
demoscene, so I would like to support rendering demoscene-esk scenes using
realistic lighting methods without having to worry about the executable
constraints which usually accompany demoscene demos.

While I eventually would like to support some combination of SDF's and triangle
meshes, implementing sound accelearation structures to support both at the same
time will take some work. So, for now scenes will either be one or the other
and thus use one of the two following ray intersection acceleration structures:

* EmbreeAccel
* SDFAccel

EmbreeAccel
-----------

As the name implies, the scenes which are described only by triangle meshes
utiliaze the Embree3 API for handling ray-scene intersections. I decided to not
reinvent the wheel when it comes to implementing this basic acceleration structure
since my implementations would probably not beat the current state of the art.

Unfortunately, there is currently no instancing of meshes in my renderer, so if
a scene is created which contains two instances of a mesh where they are just
transformed differently, the current behaviour of my renderer is to precompute
the vertex positions after performing the transform, then it feeds the transformed
mesh to embree which takes over from there.

There is currently no special setup required with embree from its default
behaviour, other than the Number of threads is currently hardcoded to 1.
Implementing efficient multithreading into the renderer and the subsequent
interactions with embree is also on the todo

If you are interested in the embree library, you can find more information on
it <a href="https://www.embree.org/">here</a>.

SDFAccel
--------

For scenes which contain only signed distance fields, I have my own acceleration
structure which is at the moment a brute force approach. It evaluates all signed
distance fields with no actual acceleration at the moment. In the future, I plan
on implementing some form of local object grouping to cull out the unnecessary
signed distance evaluations.
